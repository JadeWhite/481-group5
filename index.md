## Project Idea

Our project is to create a app that streamlines the experience of checking in, keeping track/registering for classes, and using equipment at a general recreation center. Depending on user wants, this app could also be web based, track exercises, and have an emergency notification system.

This app would be used by people attending, or wishing to attend a recreation center. Our target age are people aged from 16-60+. We target this age because it is likely children will have their guardians use the app instead.

The app will provide standard information about the recreation center (opening/closing times, closures etc.) in addition to functionality that will allow users to register and track exercise classes.
